Step 1: forst on the power .
         Give binary input 

Step 2: Assign two distinct frequencies:


ùëì
0
 for binary ‚Äò0‚Äô (lower frequency).

ùëì
1
 for binary ‚Äò1‚Äô (higher frequency).

Generate the carrier signal and see wave form on sociloscope .

 step3: give connectons as explained below-
 
  a)connect output of function generator1 to the input of  balanced modulator1 one and keep frequency high as compare to second function     geneator (suggestion).

  b) connect  ouput port of NRZ to input port of balanced modulator1 .

  c) now connect output port of balanced modulator1 to input port of summing amplifier .

  d) connect output port of function generator2 to input port of balanced modulator2 .

  e) connect output port of NRZ to input port of not gate.

  f) connect output port of not gate to input port of balanced modulator2.

  g) connect output port of balanced modulator2 to summing amplifier.

  step4: to see modulated wave form click on osciloscope and then click on output.
