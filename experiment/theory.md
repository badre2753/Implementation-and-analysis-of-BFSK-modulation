Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK) is a digital modulation technique where binary data is transmitted using two distinct frequenciesâ€”one representing a '0' and the other a '1'. The modulation process involves encoding information by shifting the frequency of a carrier signal, while demodulation extracts the original binary data from the received signal.
