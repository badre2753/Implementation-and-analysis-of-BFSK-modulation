Frequency-shift keying (FSK) is a digital modulation technique that involves varying the frequency of a carrier
signal to transmit digital information. The carrier signal is shifted between two or more frequencies to
represent different binary states in FSK. The frequency shift between the two states is typically low, and the
signal is demodulated by detecting the frequency shift. FSK is commonly used in applications such as wireless
communication, RFID, and telemetry systems.
The FSK modulation method that only uses two frequencies is called Binary FSK (BFSK). The carrier signal
frequency is shifted between the two frequencies to represent the binary data, while the phase of the carrier
signal remains constant during this process. The frequency used to represent a binary 1 is known as “mark,”
while the one used to represent a binary 0 is known as “space.”
